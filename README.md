# My Opinions About Using GitHub

## Version Control
- I have been using GitHub for quite a while now. It helps me version control my projects, safeguarding my models from unforeseen bugs and behaviors. It gives me the advantage of rolling back to previously working versions of my projects.

## Collaboration
- Collaboration is key to building scalable projects, and GitHub allows us to do just that. I have worked with different teams in the past, and GitHub lets us all work on different features asynchronously while planning a structured release cycle.
- Github also lets us document our codebase for the new collaborators to understand and contribute to the project.

## Library of Open Source
- GitHub is a huge library of open-source projects, which sometimes helps us find new approaches to problems. It also provides us with opportunities to contribute to different projects.
